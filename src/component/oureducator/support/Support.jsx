            <h2>TEACHERS AS SUPPORT <span>System</span></h2>
            <p>A student-centered model accepts that students have different 
                learning styles and absorb information at different levels. They are 
                open and receptive to various styles of learning, whether in groups 
                or individually.</p>
            <p>Educators at SFHS take on the role of a guide or facilitator for 
                students’ learning experiences. They support, encourage, provide 
                feedback, answer questions, ask questions, give suggestions, and 
                pose challenges.</p>
            <p>The Strawberry Fields High School has established an environment 
                that encourages real learning, nurtures creativity and discovery, and 
                celebrates different world-views. It has educators who facilitate 
                meaningful learning and tap into each child’s abilities, shaping 
                qualities and character to make them responsible and 
                compassionate.</p>
