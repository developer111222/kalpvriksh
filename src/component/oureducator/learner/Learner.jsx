                    <p>Our teachers don’t just adapt—they `anticipate’. Through `Adhyapan 4.0’ residencies, they:  
Co-author AI curricula with Bengaluru’s robotics labs.  
Train in desert permaculture to integrate climate science into math problems.  
Master `Naad Yoga’ (sound therapy) to enhance focus in digital-native learners.  
Each educator maintains a <b>Karma Diary,</b> tracking how they’ve merged CBSE frameworks with Kalpvriksh’s <b>5 Pillars:</b> Heritage Stewardship, Digital Dharma, Green Citizenship, Emotional Agility, and Cosmic Curiosity.
