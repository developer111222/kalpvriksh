<h1>Going beyond the <br/> "best" when best is <span>Not Enough</span></h1>

<dl>

        <p><span>Tradition study materials are made for a class assuming that the teachers will teach
            and the children will follow.</span> In Montfort curriculum, children often learn by 
            themselves. Teachers are facilitators.</p>
            
            <p>Children learn through application and discovery. Study materials are deductive and
                highly visual. Children find it easier to work with these materials and student friendly
                textbooks rather than traditional textbooks.</p>
            
            <p>A year's course work is divided into parts called semesters and periodicals. This makes
                the bag lighter. Children enjoy finishing each semester and look forward to the next.</p>

            <p>Each semester is aimed at mastery of topics inside. Children also cover more subject 
                matter in an equivalent period of time compared to typical textbook/workbook/
                notebook combinations. This is because dividing a year's course work into parts
                better engages a child's psychology.</p>
    </dt>
    <dt>
        <p>Research shows that if we double the thinking time, we double a child's 
            performance.</p>
        
        <p>At the end of each semester or periodical there is a diagnostic test for
            evaluation.</p>

        <p>Tactile understanding is followed by work in "creative worksheets" that we
            have theory is visual and creative ways. They allow self-learning and discovery.
            The work within each unit is further broken deep into short modules graded 
            from easy to difficult. Further practice sessions focus on improvement of speed
            and accuracy. Even difficult subjects like Mathematics and English grammar
            come alive for the individual child. Every child moves forward more effectively
            and more joyfully and feels more intrinsically motivated.</p>
