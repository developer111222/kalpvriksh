                <p><span>Like music, art is deeply embedded in the school curriculum.</span> Students 
                    are strongly encouraged to experiment with a variety of mediums to 
                    express themselves freely. While freedom is endorsed, it is supported 
                    with well-structured and supervised, curriculum and guidance. The Art 
                    and Craft club is an extension of this ethos and manifests itself through 
                    the regular art exhibitions that are held to commemorate diversity in 
                    culture, thought and spirit.</p>
