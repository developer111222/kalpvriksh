        <p><span>The Literary society nurtures public speaking, debating, elocution, 
            creative writing and all other literary pursuits in Hindi and English.</span> 
            The culmination of the year-long work by the Language Department is 
            showcased through two events â€“ the interschool Wordsmiths and the 
            inter-house Shiladhaar. New genres of speech, writing and oratory are 
            explored and celebrated.</p>

        <p><span>Additionally there is regular Quizzing</span> that caters to the diverse 
            interests of the students and includes Spell Bees, Just A Minute, Trivia 
            and other formats designed to build interest in the finer details and to 
            sharpen skills of collation and recall of information that defines the 
            calibre of every quiz master in the making.</p>
