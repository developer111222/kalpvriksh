        <p><span>Since teaching methods are evolving constantly, regular trainings, re-trainings
            and workshops are held with expert faculty to help teachers to hone their 
            teaching skills and orient them to new teaching methodologies.</span> These efforts 
            bring out hidden qualities that are latent while also providing ample 
            opportunity to learn from and absorb with trends that are at par with global 
            standards of teaching. </p>

        <p>Students are changing and so is the psychology of the parents. Teachers must 
            know the best techniques like how efficiently and effectively they can handle 
            classroom, crisis management, resource or material management, lesson 
            planning, curriculum development and use of technology in the classroom 
            amongst others.</p>
