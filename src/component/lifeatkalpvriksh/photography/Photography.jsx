        <p><span>Photography</span> students learn various photography techniques, such 
            as videography and still photography. The club has consistently 
            honed the skills of students to the extent that all school events, 
            including Mock United Nations and Parliamentary Debate 
            Competitions, are covered by members of the club. Further, the 
            students shoot the opening films, which include rushes and time 
            lapses, that are showcased at each event. In the high school, 
            presentations for each weekly assembly are prepared from start to 
            finish by students. The Calligraphy club trains students in the art of 
            penmanship which can be a delicate art form.</p>
